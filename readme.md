BioBench â€” AI-Reviewed Genomics Mini-Pipeline
What It Does
BioBench reads a FASTA file, finds ORFs (Open Reading Frames) on both strands, translates them to amino acids, computes QC metrics (GC%, base counts), and writes tidy outputs in multiple formats: CSV, JSON, and human-friendly HTML/Markdown summaries.

Why It Matters
Small bioinformatics pipelines often fail silently on edge cases (empty inputs, reverse-strand mapping, sequence normalization).
BioBench demonstrates how AI-driven code review and agentic automation improve correctness, reproducibility, and developer experience.

ðŸ§  AI Tools Used
CodeRabbit (IDE + PR Reviews)
Caught and helped fix correctness issues:

Empty FASTA handling in report.py (now emits valid empty artifacts + summary)

Consistent sequence normalization (uppercase + Uâ†’T) across translate.py / orf.py

CLI input validation (clear error + non-zero exit on missing file)

Reverse-strand coordinate mapping bug (now fixed + covered by test)

Goose (Subagents)
Summarizer agent reads out/report.json + out/orfs.csv and generates out/summary.md (â‰¤150 words).

Runner+Summarizer flow documented in GOOSE.md.
(Windows tool friction noted; chat-based Summarizer path still demonstrates agentic value.)
